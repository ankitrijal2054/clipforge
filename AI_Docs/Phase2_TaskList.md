## Phase 2A: Comprehensive Recording System - PRIORITY

### Setup & Dependencies

1. [ ] **Install @dnd-kit/core** - Install drag-and-drop library with `npm install @dnd-kit/core @dnd-kit/sortable @dnd-kit/utilities`. This modern library provides accessible drag-and-drop functionality for the timeline component with better performance than react-dnd and includes built-in collision detection and keyboard navigation.

2. [ ] **Create recording directory structure** - Set up new directories: `src/main/recording/` for main process recording logic, `src/renderer/src/components/RecordingPanel.tsx` for UI components. This organizes recording functionality separately from existing video processing and follows the established project structure.

3. [ ] **Add recording types** - Create `src/types/recording.ts` with interfaces for RecordingOptions, RecordingState, MediaDeviceInfo, and RecordingType. Create `src/types/timeline.ts` for TimelineClip, Track, and MultiClipExportParams. These provide TypeScript safety for new recording features and ensure consistent data structures.

4. [ ] **Update IPC handlers** - Create `src/main/ipc/recordingHandlers.ts` with handlers for `recording:getSources`, `recording:start`, `recording:stop`, `recording:pause`, `recording:resume`. These enable secure communication between renderer and main process for recording operations using Electron's context isolation.

### Screen Recording Implementation

5. [ ] **Implement desktopCapturer** - Use Electron's `desktopCapturer.getSources()` to get available screen and window sources with thumbnails. This provides the foundation for screen recording by listing all available capture targets including full screen, individual windows, and browser tabs.

6. [ ] **Create MediaRecorder wrapper** - Build a wrapper around MediaRecorder API to handle screen recording with audio capture. Include error handling, chunk management, and automatic file saving. This abstracts the complexity of MediaRecorder and provides a consistent interface for all recording types.

7. [ ] **Add source selection UI** - Create a modal dialog that displays available screen/window sources as thumbnails with names. Users can click to select their desired capture target. Include a preview of the selected source before starting recording.

8. [ ] **Implement audio device selection** - Add dropdown menus for microphone and system audio device selection. Query available audio devices using `navigator.mediaDevices.enumerateDevices()` and allow users to choose their preferred audio input sources.

9. [ ] **Add quality settings** - Implement three quality presets: High (1080p@60fps, 5Mbps), Medium (1080p@30fps, 2.5Mbps), Low (720p@30fps, 1Mbps). These settings affect both video resolution and bitrate to balance quality with file size and performance.

10. [ ] **Create recording indicator** - Display a prominent red recording dot with elapsed time counter. Include file size information and recording status. This provides clear visual feedback that recording is active and shows progress information.

15. [ ] **Implement webcam recording** - Use MediaRecorder with webcam stream to record video. Include audio capture from the same device or separate microphone. Handle different webcam resolutions and frame rates based on device capabilities.

16. [ ] **Add webcam quality settings** - Provide resolution options (1080p, 720p, 480p) and frame rate settings (30fps, 60fps) based on webcam capabilities. Include auto-focus and exposure controls if available through the device API.

### Picture-in-Picture Recording Implementation

17. [ ] **Create Canvas-based PiP system** - Build a Canvas element that overlays webcam feed on screen capture. Use `drawImage()` to composite the two video streams with proper positioning and scaling. This creates a professional picture-in-picture effect.

## Notes

- **Priority**: Recording system is the top priority and should be implemented first
- **Timeline**: Start with 2 tracks, can expand to more tracks in future phases
- **State Management**: Extend current store, split later if needed
- **Export**: Preserve original resolution, add normalization in future phases
- **Testing**: Test on all platforms throughout development
- **Performance**: Maintain 30fps+ timeline interactions and <5s app launch
