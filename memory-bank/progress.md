## What's Left to Build

- ðŸ”„ **Core Video Processing**: FFmpeg integration and video operations
- ðŸ”„ **User Interface**: All React components for video editing
- ðŸ”„ **State Management**: Zustand store and custom hooks
- ðŸ”„ **File Operations**: Import, export, and file system integration
- ðŸ”„ **Video Player**: Custom video controls and playback
- ðŸ”„ **Timeline**: Visual timeline with trim controls
- ðŸ”„ **Export System**: Video trimming and export functionality
- ðŸ”„ **Testing**: Comprehensive test suite
- ðŸ”„ **Packaging**: Cross-platform builds and distribution

## Current Status

**Ready for Phase 3**: Both Phase 0 and Phase 1 are complete, and Phase 2 (State Management) has been successfully implemented. The application now has a solid foundation with FFmpeg integration and comprehensive state management.

## Next Milestone

**Phase 3 Completion**: Import system with file dialog integration, drag and drop functionality, and media library component. This will enable users to import and manage video files.

## Risk Assessment

- **Low Risk**: Project foundation is solid
- **Medium Risk**: FFmpeg integration complexity
- **Low Risk**: UI/UX development (well-planned)
- **Medium Risk**: Cross-platform compatibility
- **Low Risk**: Performance optimization

## Quality Metrics
