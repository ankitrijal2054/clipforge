# ClipForge Active Context

## Current Work Focus

**Phase 2: State Management** - Implementing comprehensive state management with Zustand store and custom hooks for the video editing interface.

## Recent Changes

- ✅ **Phase 0.1 Complete**: Project foundation fully established
- ✅ **Project Structure**: All directories and files created
- ✅ **ShadCN/UI Setup**: Professional UI components installed and configured
- ✅ **Type Definitions**: Comprehensive TypeScript interfaces created
- ✅ **Utility Functions**: Formatters, validators, and constants implemented
- ✅ **Code Style**: Consistent formatting with single quotes and no semicolons

## Current Status

- **Foundation**: Solid and ready for development
- **Dependencies**: All installed and working
- **Configuration**: Properly configured for development
- **App State**: Running successfully in development mode
- **Next Phase**: Ready to begin FFmpeg integration

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### 1. FFmpeg Integration Strategy

- **Approach**: Bundled static binaries for all platforms
- **Rationale**: Zero external dependencies, offline functionality
- **Implementation**: Platform detection + child process execution
- **Priority**: Critical - entire app depends on this

### 2. IPC Architecture

- **Pattern**: Type-safe IPC with contextBridge
- **Security**: Context isolation enabled, node integration disabled
- **APIs**: Video metadata, trim/export, file dialogs, progress tracking

### 3. State Management

- **Store**: Zustand with comprehensive EditorStore interface
- **Pattern**: Immutable state with pure action functions
- **Features**: Media management, timeline, playback, trim, export

### 4. UI/UX Approach

- **Design System**: ShadCN/UI with custom Tailwind configuration
- **Theme**: Dark mode with professional color palette
- **Animations**: Framer Motion for smooth interactions
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance planned
