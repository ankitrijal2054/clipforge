## Current Status: Phase 2A - Recording System COMPLETE âœ… (Tasks 1-33 Complete + Bug Fixes)

**Phase 2A Status:** 100% Complete - Recording System with File Management + Bug Fixes  
**Phase 2B Status:** Ready for Implementation - Timeline System

## Recent Achievements

### âœ… **Phase 2A Tasks 1-33: Recording System + File Management** - COMPLETE

**Recording UI & Controls (Tasks 1-28):**

- Recording panel with mode selection (Screen, Webcam, PiP)
- Device selection dropdowns (audio, webcam, screen sources)
- Quality presets (High/Medium/Low)
- Recording status display with elapsed time
- Start, Pause, Resume, Stop controls
- Real-time recording feedback and error handling

**File Management & Integration (Tasks 29-33):**

- Temp file management with timestamped filenames
- Auto-import system to media library
- Timeline integration (ready for Phase 2B)
- File cleanup (automatic on app close, manual deletion)
- Recording metadata storage (duration, resolution, bitrate)

### âœ… **Bug Fixes & Refinements**

**Auto-Refresh System:**

- Recent recordings now auto-refresh immediately after recording completes
- New IPC event: `recording:dataSaved` fires when file is saved
- RecordingImporter listens to both `onRecordingStopped` and `onRecordingDataSaved`

**Duration & Metadata Tracking:**

- Recording duration now calculated from actual recording time (Date.now() delta)
- Duration passed through entire IPC chain: Renderer â†’ Main â†’ Handler â†’ Cache
- FFprobe used as fallback for metadata extraction
- Metadata caching prevents redundant extraction

**Recording Timer:**

- Timer now properly resets to 0:00 when recording stops
- Duration correctly displays in Recent Recordings list
- Videos play smoothly without stuttering

**Metadata Extraction:**

- Immediate extraction after recording is saved
- Fallback values for all fields (never NaN)
- Console logging for debugging metadata extraction
- Resolution, frame rate, bitrate properly captured

## Architecture Overview

```
Recording Flow:
1. User starts recording â†’ useScreenRecorder creates MediaRecorder
2. Recording happens â†’ Duration tracked via Date.now()
3. User stops recording â†’ recordingDuration passed to save handler
4. IPC: saveRecordingData(arrayBuffer, fileName, recordingDuration)
5. Main: Saves file, extracts/caches metadata
6. Event: recording:dataSaved fires
7. UI: RecordingImporter auto-refreshes with new recording
8. User imports â†’ Metadata preserved, clip added to library
```

## Current Capabilities

### ðŸŽ¬ **Recording System (Phase 2A)** - Production Ready

**Recording Modes:**

- âœ… Screen recording with source selection
- âœ… Webcam recording with device selection
- âœ… Picture-in-Picture mode (screen + webcam overlay)
- âœ… Quality presets (High/Medium/Low)

**File Management:**

- âœ… Automatic temp directory organization (timestamped files)
- âœ… Metadata extraction & caching
- âœ… Auto-refresh on new recordings
- âœ… Manual deletion support
- âœ… 7-day automatic cleanup on app quit

**Metadata Captured:**

- âœ… Duration (from actual recording time)
- âœ… Resolution (width Ã— height)
- âœ… Frame rate (30/60 fps)
- âœ… Bitrate
- âœ… Recording type (screen/webcam/pip)
- âœ… File size
- âœ… Creation timestamp

**User Experience:**

- âœ… Recent Recordings always visible and refreshed
- âœ… One-click import to Media Library
- âœ… Recordings stay in list after import (can reimport)
- âœ… Recording timer shows accurate duration
- âœ… Timer resets to 0:00 after recording stops
- âœ… Toast notifications for all operations
- âœ… Smooth playback without stuttering

## Files Modified/Created

### Backend (Main Process)

- `src/main/ipc/recordingHandlers.ts` - 5 new file management handlers
- `src/main/ffmpeg/metadata.ts` - Enhanced with better error handling and logging
- `src/main/index.ts` - Added cleanup on app quit

### Frontend (Renderer)

- `src/renderer/src/hooks/useRecording.ts` - Recording timer reset fix
- `src/renderer/src/hooks/useRecordingImport.ts` - Import and file management logic
- `src/renderer/src/hooks/useScreenRecorder.ts` - Duration tracking via Date.now()
- `src/renderer/src/components/recording/RecordingImporter.tsx` - Recent recordings UI with auto-refresh
- `src/renderer/src/components/recording/RecordingPanel.tsx` - Integrated RecordingImporter

### IPC Layer

- `src/preload/index.ts` - Added handlers for file management and data saved event
- `src/preload/index.d.ts` - Added type definitions

## Quality Improvements

### Performance

- Metadata caching prevents redundant FFprobe calls
- Async operations don't block UI
- Recording duration tracked efficiently via timestamps
- Auto-cleanup runs only on app quit

### Reliability

- Safe fallbacks for all metadata fields
- Graceful error handling if FFprobe fails
- Duration never becomes NaN
- Files recoverable even if metadata extraction fails

### User Experience

- Immediate feedback via toast notifications
- Recent recordings auto-refresh in real-time
- Smooth video playback at 30/60 fps
- Professional UI with animations

## IPC Handlers Summary

| Handler                       | Purpose                                |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `recording:getRecordedVideos` | List all recorded videos with metadata |
| `recording:importRecording`   | Import recording to media library      |
| `recording:getMetadata`       | Extract/retrieve recording metadata    |
| `recording:delete`            | Delete recording file                  |
| `recording:cleanup`           | Remove files older than 7 days         |
| `recording:dataSaved`         | Event fired after file is saved        |

## Next Steps

### ðŸš€ **Phase 2B: Multi-Clip Timeline** (Ready to Start)

Timeline system can leverage Phase 2A foundation:

- Duration: For clip length calculation
- Resolution: For preview rendering
- Frame rate: For timeline snapping
- Metadata cache: For fast access
