## Current Status: Phase 2A - Recording System COMPLETE âœ… (Tasks 1-33 Complete)

**Phase 2A Status:** 100% Complete - Recording System with File Management  
**Phase 2B Status:** Ready for Implementation - Timeline System

## Recent Achievements

### âœ… **Phase 2A Tasks 1-28: Recording UI & Controls** - COMPLETE

- Device selection dropdowns (audio, webcam, screen sources)
- Quality presets (High/Medium/Low)
- Recording status display with elapsed time
- Start, Pause, Resume, Stop controls
- Real-time recording feedback and error handling

### âœ… **Phase 2A Tasks 29-33: File Management & Auto-Import** - COMPLETE

- **Task 29:** Temp file management (timestamped files in OS temp directory)
- **Task 30:** Auto-import system (recordings extractable to media library)
- **Task 31:** Timeline integration (ready for Phase 2B)
- **Task 32:** File cleanup (automatic on app close, manual deletion via UI)
- **Task 33:** Recording metadata storage (all recording info extracted & cached)

**Files Created/Modified:**

- `src/main/ipc/recordingHandlers.ts` - Enhanced with file management handlers
- `src/preload/index.ts` - Added IPC wrappers for file operations
- `src/preload/index.d.ts` - Added type definitions for file management
- `src/renderer/src/hooks/useRecordingImport.ts` - New import hook
- `src/renderer/src/components/recording/RecordingImporter.tsx` - New importer component
- `src/renderer/src/components/recording/RecordingPanel.tsx` - Updated with importer
- `FILE_MANAGEMENT_GUIDE.md` - Comprehensive documentation
- `src/main/index.ts` - Added cleanup on app quit

## File Management Architecture

### New IPC Handlers

- `recording:getRecordedVideos` - List recorded videos
- `recording:importRecording` - Import to media library
- `recording:getMetadata` - Extract recording metadata
- `recording:delete` - Delete recording file
- `recording:cleanup` - Cleanup old recordings (7+ days)

### New React Components

- **RecordingImporter** - Shows recent recordings with import/delete buttons
- **useRecordingImport** - Hook for import operations and file management

### Integration

- RecordingImporter integrated into RecordingPanel
- Seamless workflow: Record â†’ Import â†’ Edit in Media Library
- Metadata cached for fast access
- Toast notifications for user feedback
